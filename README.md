This repository archives various scripts I've written to streamline animation workflows. Here you'll find tools and utilities developed for different animation needs.

What's Inside?
This repository contains a collection of scripts for animation in adobe after effect, including:
Batch changing composition or layer properties, Modifying values of multiple objects, etc.
These scripts are designed for quick execution after you've completed your initial setup. They typically run without alerts or conditional logic. Each script has its own specific instructions, usually found within the script file as comments. 
If you have questions or encounter issues with a script:
- Check the script file: Look for comments or documentation inside.
- Open an issue: If the script doesn't explain it, feel free to open an issue. Please provide clear details.

Cheers!
